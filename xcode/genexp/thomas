The aging mouse map is a collaborative project supported by the National Institute of Aging (P01AG049665). We harvested tissues from the indicated sites in the mouse over the lifespan and subjected them to RNA-Seq (Figure).


Here we present our data in an interactive format. This tool allows investigators to query individual genes within different tissues that were found in the dataset. Details for the isolation and processing of individual tissues, sequencing of samples and QC metrics for the data can be found in our publication.
