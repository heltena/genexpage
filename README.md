The aging influenza map is a collaborative project supported by the 
**National Institute of Aging (P01AG049665)**. 

We harvested tissues from the indicated sites in the mouse over the 
lifespan and subjected them to RNA-Seq (Figure). From the lung, we 
used flow cytometry cell sorting to sort alveolar macrophages and 
alveolar type II cells from single cell tissue suspensions in na√Øve mice.

An important clinical feature of aging is the increased susceptibility to stress. For example, mortality attributable to influenza A pneumonia increases exponentially as a function of age in humans. This age-related susceptibility to infection can be reproduced in mice infected with influenza A viruses. Accordingly, we examined the response to influenza A infection in mice 4 days after a dose of influenza A that was lethal to old mice but not to young mice (10 pfu/animal, intratracheal), and a dose of influenza A that was lethal to all mice (150 pfu/animal intratracheal).

Here we present our data in an interactive format. This tool allows investigators to query individual genes within different tissues that were found in the dataset. Details for the isolation and processing of individual tissues, sequencing of samples and QC metrics for the data can be found in our publication.
